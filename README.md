## Overview

This project is the focus of San Francisco State University's Computer Science Course 648 — Software Engineering. The class is a capstone for students pursuing a bachelor degree in Computer Science. The project encompasses the use of a full stack, both front end and back end development skills, and team driven results. It allows for each student to develop their skills as a software developer and contribute to a team based project using industry based tools and resources.

This specific web application based project is to provide a source for San Francisco State Univeristy students a new forum to list and sell to one another. It is for the sole use by San Francisco State University students as registration is confined to those with a school provided emails address. Searching and browsing is available to everyone that doesn't have an account, however the purchasing, selling and contacting actions are disable to those not logged in. New features will be added to the *Features* section of this document as they become available.
