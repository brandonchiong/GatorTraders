##Executive Summary
Located in San Francisco CA, San Francisco State University has a rich history of students who have made major impacts on the world and has shown its ability to produce well rounded individuals. Amongst the local community at SF State there are many students who seek to buy and sell products with one another but there isn’t yet an efficient way to do so. That being said, Gatortraders.com is currently being developed to allow students of San Francisco State to buy and sell products with one another, as well as post the products in which they would like to sell so that other students can view them. Along with posting products, the online platform will also allow students to search for products based on the products name and description.
	In terms of funding the project, Gatortraders.com has many features which investors should be interested in. The online platform is connecting students with one another to buy and sell from one another, which allows Gatortraders.com to have customers that will spend much time on the platform. This can be monetized through multiple different ways such as advertisements. Another valuable attribute of GatorTraders.com is the collection of information on what people are interested in buying at the time which is valuable information for many businesses.
	The team developing this platform consists of six students who attend San Francisco State University. Not only do the students know how the local community operates, but they also have a great understanding of what college students are interested in, which is key in the development of this product. With six students on the development team, there is a lot of communication and productiveness that will lead to a great product for the students of SF State.


##Use Cases
####Use Case: Seller
Steve is a fourth year San Francisco State University student who will be graduating once this current spring semester ends. He has stored up all of his textbooks from all four years but since he will be graduating soon, he figured there is not a need for all these textbooks anymore. During one of his classes, he overheard one of his classmate talk about a website that is similar to websites like Craigslist but only for SFSU students. This website allows SFSU students to browse for whatever items they desire and if something catches their eyes, they can buy it then and there. On the other hand, if a student wants to sell an item(s) the website provides that function as well. The website is only provided for students who are SFSU students so to buy or sell anything, one must need their SFSU ID number to create an account to use all the functions of the website. Steve wants to help others by selling his textbooks for a cheaper price since he experienced firsthand how pricey buying textbooks can get. He ends up posting up his textbooks and they were all sold by the time next school semester starts when he has officially become a SFSU alumni.

####Use Case: Buyer
Max is an incoming first year student who will be attending San Francisco State University when fall comes. Since Max is a first year student, he decides to live close to campus by living in one of the dorms provided by the University so that he would not have to commute back to his hometown and so that he would not have to be late to his classes and extracurricular activities by using public transportation. Max needed to buy some items because the housing department did not provide enough of the items he has been using at home. His brother, who is now a San Francisco State Alumni, mentioned that he used this website provided only to SFSU students to sell his textbooks to other SFSU students. Max went onto this website and created an account using his SFSU ID number because the website needs to verify if he truly is a student at SFSU. Once all the registration for the account has been completed and he has been able to verify his student status, he processed to the website and started to browse the different categories listed there. Max wanted to narrow down his search so he searched up specific keywords to reduce the number of results of items in the list. He ended up searching for a lamp, a coffee table, a coffee maker machine, a bed comfortable, a few textbooks, and a calculator. Once his search has been completed, he proceeded to checkout and purchased all the items he has added onto his cart to better improve his dorm life experience.

####Use Case: Administrator
Allan is an administrator of the website. As he is browsing the listings placed on the site, he stumbles upon a vulgar listing. Allan decides that it is inappropriate and decides to take down the listing from the website. He first informs the seller that his listing is inappropriate then removes it from the site.

GatorTraders.com has clear and valuable advantages over its competitors in the market.  Its location at the San Francisco State University campus provides students with convenience.  The ease of use will attract students looking to buy or sell items. The dynamic and competitive pricing of GatorTraders.com makes it a clear favorite over the SFSU Bookstore for custom SFSU books and supplies. Using GatorTraders.com on campus avoids the hassle of shipping and handling, while also avoiding sales tax.


##High-level system architecture
The development team is building its product with Amazon Web Service using a Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP server, otherwise known as a LAMP Stack. This will provide for optimal uptime, scalability and a greater level of consistency for user’s experience. We have chosen to use the Symfony PHP framework with the deployment of this web application as the framework is widely used which has cultivated abundant resources. For design purposes, we have decided that the Bootstrap Stack will allow for the best browsing experience on the four most relevant browsers used, Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. To help with design elements other languages in the Bootstrap Stack such as JQuery, JavaScript, and Less will be used sparingly to implement effects.
